# Credit Risk Analysis Project


## Overview

###### This project aims to analyze credit risk using a logistic regression model. The model is designed to predict the likelihood of a loan being high-risk (1) or healthy (0) based on various features such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, and more.

## Data
### Lending Data
The dataset (lending_data.csv) used for this analysis includes the following columns:

- ###### loan_size: The size of the loan.
- ###### interest_rate: The interest rate of the loan.
- ###### borrower_income: The income of the borrower.
- ###### debt_to_income: The debt-to-income ratio.
- ###### num_of_accounts: The number of accounts the borrower has.
- ###### derogatory_marks: The number of derogatory marks on the borrower's credit report.
- ###### total_debt: The total debt of the borrower.
- ###### loan_status: The target variable, where 0 indicates a healthy loan and 1 indicates a high-risk loan.


## Results
###### The model achieves high precision, recall, and accuracy.
